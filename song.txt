 "All You're Dreaming Of"

Paint the night sky
While the morning waits
With a field of stars
To keep the dark at bay
Take your spotlight
Underneath the moon
Sometimes a miracle
Is all that can carry you

Oh what, are you dreaming of?
Is it the kind of love
That'll be there when the world is at its worst?
That'll cover you in kisses unrehearsed
When you're losing ground, still tell you that you're worth
All you're dreaming of

Should the pain birds
Come and rest their wings
Upon your windowsill
Without a song to sing
Close your eyes and
Disappear inside
All that is beautiful
Was following behind

Oh what, are you dreaming of?
Is it the kind of love
That'll be there when the world is at its worst?
That'll cover you in kisses unrehearsed
When you're losing ground, still tell you that you're worth
All you're dreaming of (All you're dreaming of)

All you're dreaming of (All you're dreaming of)
All you're dreaming of (All you're dreaming of)

Oh what, are you dreaming of?
Is it the kind of love
That'll be there when the world is at its worst?
That'll cover you in kisses unrehearsed
When you're losing ground, still tell you that you're worth
All you're dreaming of
